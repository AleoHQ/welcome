## 1. Installation

- Please see [the installation page](00_app_installation.md) to setup the React + Javascript + Leo template.
- Next, install [Aleo's transaction cannon](https://github.com/AleoHQ/tx-cannon), this will help you deploy and execute your programs.
- Finally, install [snarkOS](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS), this will connect your application to a live devnet either locally or on AWS.
- Also, make sure you have [tmux](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tmux) installed.

After you've successfully installed these components, you're ready to go!

```bash
npm create aleo-app@latest
```

## 2. Navigation

Navigate to the project you just installed using:

```bash
cd aleo-project
npm install
npm run install-leo
npm run dev
```
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

This installs all the required modules and also Leo, our statically-typed programming language built for writing private applications. Your React application can be found at http://localhost:5173.

`src/App.jsx` contains the main body of your React application.

`src/workers/worker.js` is the WebAssembly (WASM) module that we'll be initializing for deployment and execution of Leo programs. You can deploy and execute programs through the React App or use the handy transaction cannon we've made as well.

The `helloworld` folder is your Leo program. This is where you‚Äôll use Leo.

## Start a local Aleo Devnet

Let's get to your snarkOS directory and run the local devnet script. 

```bash
cd snarkOS
./devnet.sh
```
You'll be confronted with some options, these are fine:

```bash
Enter the total number of validators (default: 4): 4
Do you want to run 'cargo install --path .' to build the binary? (y/n, default: y): n
Do you want to clear the existing ledger logs? (y/n, default: n): n
```

Right as the node is started, you'll see information for node 0, copy this down! Here are some helpful `tmux` commands to ensure you don't miss that information.

```bash
ctrl+b+[  # enter scroll mode
ctrl+b+w  # see all 4 validator nodes
ctrl+b+:kill-session  # kills the session
```

The node information should look something like this:

```bash
- üëã Welcome to Aleo! We thank you for running a node and supporting privacy.
- üîë Your development private key for node 0 is <private key>
- ü™™ Your Aleo address is <address>
- üß≠ Starting a validator node on Aleo Testnet 3 Phase 3 at 0.0.0.0:4130
- üåê Starting the REST server at 0.0.0.0:3030
- üîë Your one-time JWT token is <jwt-token>
```

Check that your network is running by using http://localhost:3030/testnet3/latest/height in your browser. The height should move up.

## 3. Execute `helloworld.aleo` locally

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and open up the developer console in your browser.

<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

Execution of the `helloworld.aleo` program (in the helloworld folder) should happen locally and you should see an output pop up.

![execution-console](./images/execution-console.png)

![execution-success](./images/execution-success.png)

Remember, this is local execution. We haven't done anything with the devnet that we just spun up.

## 4. Deploying your Program

Let‚Äôs deploy the `helloworld` program. Deployment requires an account with Aleo credits.

Luckily, the devnet you started with the private key you jotted down is seeded already with credits. However, if you want, you can go through and generate a new account and use our faucets as well, below. 

Or, skip to [deployment](#Leo-&-`helloworld`).

### Account Generation

```bash
leo account new 
```

Write down your private key, view key, and public address in a safe place. Treat your private and view keys as keys you should never share with anyone else. 

### Faucet

Once you have your account, use our faucet to get some Aleo credits! We have a faucet by text and one via Discord.
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
Head to our [faucet page](https://faucet.aleo.org/) and follow the instructions there. 
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

After the credits have been disbursed to your address, note your transaction ID down.

You can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aleohq) and use the `#faucet` channel if texting isn't working. You can send only one request every 20 minutes and can only request 50 credits per hour. Once you send a faucet request, Discord will start a thread under the faucet channel with your request.

Format:

```bash
/sendcredits aleo1address amt
```

Example:
```bash
/sendcredits aleo1k53lck74r93q70ftjvpkmnl5h9uwcna5wqyt80ggmz5w7lck8syskpxj46 20
```

Note down your transaction ID in the back of the URL from the faucet. The success message in the Discord thread should look like this:

```bash
Transfer successful! for message ID: 1156693507768078496
https://apiv2.aleo.network/testnet3/transaction/at12u62xwfew2rq32xee8nwhtlxghfjz7mm3528yj240nuezue625fqy4lhlp
```

### Leo & `helloworld`

We have a clean devnet running at http://localhost:3030. What we want to do now is to deploy our helloworld program to that network.

We can deploy it straight through our React app or we can do it through the transaction cannon. Both methods utilize the SDK.

START START HERE

```bash
import helloworld_program from "../helloworld_[randomsuffix]/build/main.aleo?raw";
```

Let's dig in a little more. Navigate back to your Leo project and Add your private key to the `.env` in your new Aleo project. Replace the example private key with the one you saved above.

```bash
NETWORK=testnet3
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp2FCZZ7ucNVx5hoofizpq18mvCZNKTpqKMTt1wTahmxSf
```

Once you've done this, within the root of your new Leo project, you can locally execute your Leo program while developing it:

```bash
leo run  ## compiles leo to aleo instructions and executes program functions with input variables

leo execute  ## compiles leo to aleo instructions, executes a program with input variables, synthesizes the program circuit, and generates proving and verifying keys

leo help  ## you know what this does
```

You can try it yourself and observe the outputs in the terminal.

```bash
leo run main
leo execute main
```

Let's get back to deploying!

When you deploy a program, the record that you requested from the faucet is the one that will be used in order to pay for deployment. Looking in `App.jsx`, the web worker is called in order to start the deployment. Following that to `src/workers/worker.js` we see that the WASM is initalized, which allows for computation to run efficiently in the browser, and that the program manager contains methods for authoring, deploying, and interacting with Aleo programs. 

Thing is, we can hit deploy right now, but it‚Äôll take some time to scan for transactions on the blockchain, so let‚Äôs provide the *exact* record that we‚Äôll be pulling the fee from. This significantly quickens the deployment process, and you‚Äôll learn about decrypting records in the process.

### Decrypting Records

When you requested credits from the faucet, you are now an owner of a private by default record with credits. Let‚Äôs find that record within the transaction.

Take your transaction ID from the Discord URL earlier:

```bash
at12u62xwfew2rq32xee8nwhtlxghfjz7mm3528yj240nuezue625fqy4lhlp
``` 
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
Go to ‚ÄúGet Transaction‚Äù at [aleo.tools/rest](https://aleo.tools/rest) and insert your transaction ID to look at the JSON object. You can similarly use https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1/testnet3/transaction/[insert-your-transaction-id] to get the same output in your browser. 
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable-->

![get-transaction](./images/get-transaction.png)

Look at¬†`object.execution.transitions[0].outputs[0].value`¬†and copy the ciphertext stored there. It should look something like this:

```bash
record1qyqspk3emhy5wzu4zg59ynhwtcpwg6ez6k4cl9d690hhqcd36pqh3vcpqyxx66trwfhkxun9v35hguerqqpqzqrtc3d8s5qrlufglkk3gkvgj3w2xdul2kl0pxhvt7f85qfxm0dcpt4g5gf6u356sgte9cyzqhj940l6qsdk5uf7u2xcwfv4zrvmeqdpzjrt848
```

Navigate to [aleo.tools/record](https://aleo.tools/record) and insert the record value along with your view key that you saved earlier. You are the owner of the record, and therefore, you have the view key in order to decrypt it to show the plaintext.

![decrypt-record](./images/decrypt-record.png)

Once decrypted, copy the plaintext record and paste it into line 67 of `src/workers/worker.js`. We can comment out line 64 since we don‚Äôt want the scanning function active, and instead, we want the optional manual option.

The final result in `worker.js` should look something like this:

```javascript
// // Deploy the program to the Aleo network
// const tx_id = await programManager.deploy(program, fee);

// Optional: Pass in fee record manually to avoid long scan times
const feeRecord = "{owner: aleo1qpjvun06n87jne3jwkml4jwdjqalw7n2qms03mcamenzczrj0uysp85fit.private, microcredits: 50000000u64.private, _nonce: 7736650979063383113375091219637426887776503149825722849440478642541635263210group.public}";
const tx_id = await programManager.deploy(program, fee, undefined, feeRecord);
```

Now you can hit the deploy button! 

![deployment-console](./images/deployment-console.png)

![deployment-success](./images/deployment-success.png)

Success, you‚Äôve deployed an Aleo program and can how create a decentralized, private application!

## Recap & Additional Resources

1. We packaged a React template for you with Leo.

2. You also installed [Leo](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/), our statically-typed programming language built for writing private applications. Using Leo, you can write, build, compile, and execute Leo programs locally.

3. We provided the `helloworld` Leo program already pre-compiled into Aleo instructions and then executed it locally using WASM + web workers, which was an abstraction on snarkVM‚Äôs capabilities. [snarkVM](https://developer.aleo.org/aleo/) is the data execution layer. It is used to compile Leo programs and execute them locally off-chain. All Leo programs eventually become Aleo instructions via Aleo‚Äôs compiler during the execution phase of snarkVM. 

4. Similarly, we deployed the `helloworld` program, again using the WASM + web workers abstraction layer but you can also deploy programs on-chain using [snarkOS](https://developer.aleo.org/testnet/getting_started/deploy_execute/#deploy), the data availability layer or blockchain / distributed ledger.

5. During the tutorial you navigated to [aleo.tools](https://aleo.tools), which is the graphical interface to our SDK, which serves as an abstraction layer of snarkOS and snarkVM. You‚Äôll find you can perform similar actions (compiling, executing, deploying) on aleo.tools. 


6. The entire React template along with the WASM and web workers can also be considered an abstraction layer of snarkOS and snarkVM.
